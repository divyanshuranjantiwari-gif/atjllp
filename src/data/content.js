      <p class="mb-4">The GST Council, in its 55th meeting, has announced a new Amnesty Scheme to provide relief to taxpayers with pending returns and disputes. This move is expected to reduce litigation and help businesses clean up their compliance records.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Key Highlights of the Scheme</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Waiver of Late Fees:</strong> Complete waiver of late fees for GSTR-1, GSTR-3B, and GSTR-4 for the period July 2017 to March 2024, provided returns are filed by March 31, 2026.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Penalty:</strong> Penalty for non-compliance in e-invoicing has been capped at ₹10,000 per default.</li>
        <li><strong>Appeal Withdrawal:</strong> Taxpayers can withdraw pending appeals and pay 50% of the disputed tax amount to settle the case.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Who Should Opt for This?</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">This scheme is highly beneficial for MSMEs who struggled with compliance during the initial years of GST implementation or during the pandemic. It offers a clean slate to regularize your tax standing without the burden of exorbitant penalties.</p>
      <p>Contact our GST team today to evaluate your eligibility and file your pending returns.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">Startups in India enjoy a plethora of tax benefits, yet many founders miss out on them due to lack of awareness. Proper tax planning from Day 1 can save significant capital that can be reinvested into growth.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Essential Tax Exemptions</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Section 80-IAC:</strong> 100% tax deduction on profits for 3 consecutive years out of the first 10 years. Requires DPIIT recognition and Inter-Ministerial Board approval.</li>
        <li><strong>Angel Tax Exemption:</strong> Investments received from resident angel investors are exempt from tax under Section 56(2)(viib) for recognized startups.</li>
        <li><strong>ESOP Taxation:</strong> Deferment of tax payment on ESOPs for employees, making it a lucrative tool for talent retention.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Structuring for Success</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Choosing the right entity type (Private Limited vs LLP) is crucial. While LLPs have lower compliance, Private Limited companies are preferred by VCs. We recommend a Private Limited structure for high-growth startups aiming for external funding.</p>
